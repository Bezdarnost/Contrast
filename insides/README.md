Baseline is a HAT with (S)W-MSA replaced by SS2D blocks from VMambaV2

I've made the comparison in training with batch size 8 and patch size 64 of low-resolution image for X4 task on my RTX 3060:

**Speed of training**

*For one epoch (11,056 batches)
- HAT-light - approximately 2 hours and 1 minute (**121 minutes**). 
- Baseline - approximately 1 hour and 10 minutes (**70 minutes**). (The baseline is approximately **41.3% faster**).
- Baseline without Positional Embeddings - approximately 1 hour and 00 minutes (**60 minutes**).

**Memory requierements**
- HAT-light **11.2 GB**. 
- Baseline **8 GB.** (The baseline is approximately **28.6% better**).
- Baseline without Positional Embeddings **7.8 GB**.

I've made the training for 50 000 iterations and saved model weights and metrics for each 5 000 iterations, trained with MSELoss and Adam(lr=2e-4)
