Baseline is a HAT with (S)W-MSA replaced by SS2D blocks from VMambaV2

I've made the comparison in training with batch size 8 and patch size 64 of low-resolution image for X4 task on my RTX 3060:

**Speed of training**
- HAT-light for one epoch (11,056 batches) took approximately 2 hours and 25 minutes (**145 minutes**). 
- Baseline for one epoch (11,056 batches) took around 1 hour and 25 minutes (**85 minutes**). (The baseline is approximately **41.4% faster**).

**Memory requierements**
- HAT-light **12 GB**. 
- Baseline **9 GB.** (The baseline is approximately **25% better**).

I've made the training for 50 000 iterations and saved model weights and metrics for each 5 000 iterations, trained with MSELoss and Adam(lr=2e-4)
