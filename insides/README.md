Baseline is a HAT with (S)W-MSA replaced by SS2D blocks from VMambaV2

model = Contrast(

I've made the comparison in training with batch size 8 and patch size 64 of low-resolution image for X4 task on my RTX 3060:

<summary>HAT-light hyperparameters details:</summary>
  
```
Same depth-1, num_head-1, window_size, dims, upscaler and other details as my baseline Contrast
```
  
</details>

I've made the training and saved model weights and metrics for each ∼48 000 images, trained with MSELoss and Adam(lr=2e-4)

For Contrast_no_pe_no_ca I've removed positional embeddings and channel attention and added more layers to save amount of parameters(∼1.5M). Also I want to mention, that I made different amount of training so that's why the lines are different lengths.

Its the number of parameters of this models:
| Model | Parameters |
|----------|----------|
| baseline | 745,572 |
| baseline_no_pe | 718,194 |
| baseline_no_pe_no_cab | 764,202 |
| mamba(pure) | 759,108 |
| hat_light | 771,099 |
